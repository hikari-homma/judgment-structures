# Case Logs: The Evidence Lab

This directory serves as the evidence base for the **SRCM Model** defined in [REASON.md](../REASON.md). 

Here, we document real-world instances of judgment — specifically focusing on moments where meaning was generated, distorted, or structurally blocked.

## Understanding the Logs

Each case is a "specimen" of decision-making. We move beyond "what was said" to analyze "what happened to the meaning."

### The SRCM Analysis
When reviewing these cases, we look at:
- **S (Speaker):** What was the implicit intent?
- **R (Receiver):** What internal model did the receiver apply?
- **C (Constraint):** What power, budget, or structural filter intervened?
- **M (Meaning):** What action was actually triggered?

## Case Index (Mapping to Theory)

As we migrate logs from the initial observation phase (V1), they are categorized by their primary failure mode:

| Category | Primary Driver | Case IDs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interpretation Mismatch** | $S \leftrightarrow R$ gap | (TBD) |
| **Contextual Distortion** | $C$ (Constraint) | (TBD) |
| **Structural Collapse** | System failure | (TBD) |

## Stance
These logs are raw observations. They are not "problems to be solved," but "structures to be understood."

Still observing. Still not optimizing.

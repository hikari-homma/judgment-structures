# Judgment Template v1  
## ## Meaning-Making–Driven Judgment Flow

This template describes a minimal structure of human judgment,
focused on meaning-making rather than behavior or outcomes.

It is not a psychological theory, moral framework, or optimization model.  
It is a structural description of how decisions *actually diverge*.

---

## Core Structure

1. Humans assign meaning to situations  
2. Meaning-making happens mostly unconsciously  
3. Actions are automatically selected based on that meaning  
4. A sense of discomfort or mismatch may arise  
5. If there is no way to exit or reframe the meaning, action becomes distorted

---

## Key Notes

- “Meaning” here does not refer to emotion or intention  
- It refers to cognitive framing (importance, correctness, success, failure, role, expectation)
- Most decisions do not feel like decisions; they feel “natural” or “obvious”
- Distortion does not mean irrationality — it means **structural pressure**

---

## Interpretation Guide

- **No discomfort**  
  → Action follows meaning smoothly

- **Discomfort + exit route exists**  
  → Meaning can be revised or exited  
  → Action changes

- **Discomfort + no exit route**  
  → Meaning remains fixed  
  → Action expresses itself as tension, impulse, or contradiction

## Scope

This template can be applied to:
- Creative decisions (writing, film, design)
- Social behavior and roles
- Work, evaluation, and performance contexts
- AI-assisted decision-making and human–AI interaction

This is a *generalized structure*.  
Specific cases (e.g. artists, systems, organizations) are instantiations, not exceptions.

## Status

Version: v1  
This template is intentionally minimal.  
Extensions and branches are expected.
No examples are included at this stage to avoid premature fixation.

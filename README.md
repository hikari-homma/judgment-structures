This is a long-term personal research project.

Judgment Structure is an experimental UI that visualizes **when judgment becomes possible, impossible, or silently deferred**—rather than attempting to “fix” ambiguous requests.

Its purpose is to observe what actually happens during linguistic communication, particularly **instructions and requests within hierarchical relationships**, such as corporate environments or client–worker dynamics.

In the early stages of this research, I assumed that communication problems were primarily caused by **abstract request words** (e.g. “make it feel right,” “from a user perspective”).

However, through iterative observation up to v0.3, I found that **abstract words themselves are not the root cause**.

Instead, the effect of a word emerges from the interaction between:

**word × domain × phase**

Here, *domain* refers to contexts such as product development, meetings, video production, or writing.

*Phase* refers to stages such as planning, design, implementation, or adjustment.

I also realized that **explicit requests**—often assumed to be safer or clearer—produce their own distinct problems.

In other words, the impact of a request is not inherent to whether it is abstract or explicit, but depends on how it interacts with domain and phase.

This project does not attempt to resolve these problems directly.

Instead, it visualizes **where judgment breaks down**, **who is forced to judge**, and **what kind of next action is realistically available**—such as continuing to ask questions, proposing a hypothesis, or stopping observation altogether.

On the other hand, problems caused by external constraints—such as **budget, time, or organizational power structures**—are treated as **structural preconditions**, not communication failures.

These fall outside the scope of this UI and are intentionally not “solved” here.

## What this is not

- Not a tool to resolve vague requests
- Not a UX best-practice framework
- Not a decision automation system

## Current status

- Judgment Structure — V1 (Prototype)
- Observational / exploratory
- Structural model of judgment types established
- UI sketches and structure in progress

## Project Materials

This repository also contains supplementary materials:

- `note/` – Personal notes and case observations
- `template/` – Templates used for judgment extraction

# Judgment Templates & Structural Experiments

This repository contains experiments in translating  
**human judgment, meaning-making, and decision structures**  
into explicit, reusable, and programmable forms.

The goal is not optimization or automation,
but **making implicit cognitive structures explicit**.

---

## What this is

- A collection of **judgment templates**
- Structural thinking expressed in:
  - natural language
  - diagrams (later)
  - pseudocode / code (later)
- An attempt to fix **decision logic**, not outcomes

This work treats:
- writing
- visual direction
- and programming

as variations of the same activity:
**designing cognitive transitions**.

---

## Core idea

Humans do not act directly on reality.

They act on:
- meanings
- interpretations
- internalized expectations

This repository explores how those processes can be:
- observed
- simplified
- abstracted
- and reused across domains.

---

## Current state

- Language-first exploration
- Minimal templates
- No formal implementation yet

This is intentional.

Code comes **after** structure stabilizes.

---

## Background

These experiments are informed by:
- 20 years of visual decision-making practice
- cinematography and visual direction
- editing and structural thinking
- recent exploration of AI as a judgment amplifier, not a replacement

This is **not** a cultural critique.
This is **not** philosophy for explanation.

It is a working surface for judgment.

---

## Status

Early stage / work in progress.

Expect:
- rewrites
- deletions
- structural changes

That instability is part of the method.

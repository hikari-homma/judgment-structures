# Judgment Structure
**A framework to analyze where human judgment fails — and why UI cannot always fix it.**

A structural exploration of how meaning is formed and why decisions stall in professional environments  
(film, engineering, UI/UX, and beyond).

## Project Evolution

### Phase 1: Theory V1 — Observation (Phenomena)
**Focus:** Observing how judgment breaks, stalls, or defers in practice.  
I started by assuming judgment fails because requests are vague.  
I tracked triggers like *“Make it feel right”* or *“Make it simpler”* to see where judgment stops.

### Phase 2: Theory V2 — Foundation (Mechanics)
**Focus:** SRCM — Meaning formation under constraint.  
The question shifted to: **Where is meaning actually formed?**  
I use the model:

$$M = f(S, R, C)$$

Meaning ($M$) is not transmitted. It is generated through:
- $S$ = Speaker
- $R$ = Receiver
- $C$ = Context / Constraints

## Repository Guide

- **theory/** — Start with [v1](./theory/v1.md), then [v2](./theory/v2.md)
- **cases/** — Real-world logs (C-008 to C-024) mapped to theory *(WIP)*
- **templates/** — Experimental UI templates for judgment observation

## Why This Project Exists

1. **Prevent misattribution** — stop the “it’s just communication” excuse  
2. **Define the boundary of UI** — where UI can help (S/R alignment) vs. where constraints dominate (C)  
3. **Observe before optimizing** — map failure structure before proposing “solutions”

---

## Stance
Still observing. Still not optimizing.

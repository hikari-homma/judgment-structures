# Judgment Structure
**A framework to analyze where human judgment fails — and why UI cannot always fix it.**

This project is a structural exploration of how meaning is formed and why decisions stall in professional environments (Film, engineering, UI/UX, and beyond).

## 📂 Project Evolution

The project is structured into two theoretical phases to show the evolution from observation to mechanics.

### [Phase 1: Theory V1 — Observation (Phenomena)](./theory/v1.md)
**Focus:** Observing how judgment breaks, stalls, or defers in practice.
Originally, I assumed judgment failed because requests were vague. I observed triggers like *"Make it feel right"* or *"Make it simpler"* to see where judgment stopped or was deferred.

### [Phase 2: Theory V2 — Foundation (Mechanics)](./theory/v2.md)
**Focus:** The SRCM Model — Meaning Formation under Constraint.
In this phase, the core question shifted: **“Where is meaning actually formed?”**
I introduce the formula:
$$M = f(S, R, C)$$
Where Meaning ($M$) is not transmitted, but generated through the interaction of the Speaker ($S$), the Receiver ($R$), and structural Constraints ($C$).

## 📂 Repository Guide

- **[/theory](./theory/)**: The evolution of the logic. Start with [v1.md] for observed patterns, then proceed to [v2.md] for the SRCM model.
- **[/cases](./cases/)**: (Work in Progress) Real-world evidence and logs (C-008 to C-024) mapped to the theory.
- **[/templates](./templates/)**: Experimental UI designs for visualizing judgment flows.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

1. **To prevent misattribution:** Stopping the "it's just a communication problem" excuse.
2. **To define the boundary of UI:** Clarifying where design can help (S/R Alignment) and where it is structurally impossible (C Dominance).
3. **To observe without optimizing:** We map the "structure" of failure before proposing "solutions."

## Stance
Still observing. Still not optimizing.

# Judgment Structure — Theory v1  
Structural patterns of judgment breakdown

This document maps observable patterns of judgment breakdown and clarifies where UI intervention stops.
---

## Overview

Judgment Structure is a long-term personal research project exploring  
**when judgment becomes possible, impossible, or silently deferred**  
in linguistic communication.

This work does **not** attempt to fix ambiguous requests.

Instead, it observes **where judgment breaks**, **who is forced to judge**,  
and **what kind of next action is realistically available**  
within hierarchical relationships such as corporate environments  
or client–worker dynamics.

---

## Motivation

In the early stages of this research, I assumed that communication problems  
were primarily caused by **abstract request words**  
(e.g. “make it feel right”, “from a user perspective”).

However, through iterative observation up to v0.3,  
I found that **abstract words themselves are not the root cause**.

Instead, the effect of a request emerges from the interaction between:

**word × domain × phase**

- **Domain**: product development, meetings, video production, writing, etc.  
- **Phase**: planning, design, implementation, adjustment.

I also observed that **explicit requests**, often assumed to be safer,  
produce their own distinct failures.

In short, the impact of a request is not inherent to its clarity or vagueness,  
but depends on how it interacts with domain and phase.

## Visual Overview

An experimental UI diagram was created to map recurring judgment patterns.

- **Vertical axis**: whether judgment failure is UI-addressable  
- **Horizontal axis**: whether judgment is resolved or unresolved

## Judgment Types (v1)

| Type | Name | State | UI Rescue |
|------|------|-------|-----------|
| A | Reference Missing | Judgment cannot be formed | Yes |
| B | Reference-Resolved | Judgment possible with references | Yes |
| C | Immediate Comprehension | Judgment formed immediately | Not required |
| D | Structural Mismatch | Judgment blocked by constraints | No |
| E | Authority Override | Judgment overridden by power | No |
| F | Explanation Avoidance | Judgment exists, explanation withheld | No |
| G | Surface Compliance | Pseudo-resolved judgment | Partial |

---

## A｜Reference Missing

**State**  
Judgment cannot be formed because no reference, comparison axis,  
or evaluation criteria exist.

**Description**  
The request may sound abstract, but the core issue is not vagueness itself.  
Without any reference point, judgment has nothing to anchor to  
and stalls completely.

**UI Rescue**  
**Yes** — UI can surface missing references and prompt comparison axes.

---

## B｜Reference-Resolved

**State**  
Judgment can be formed because concrete references or examples are provided.

**Description**  
Although the request itself may remain abstract,  
the presence of references activates judgment.  
Comparison becomes possible, reducing cognitive load.

**UI Rescue**  
**Yes** — UI can organize references and support structured comparison.

---

## C｜Immediate Comprehension

**State**  
Judgment is formed immediately from the input alone.

**Description**  
The word triggers internal references within the receiver.  
No additional clarification or comparison is required.

**UI Rescue**  
**No (Not required)** — Judgment is already stable.

---

## D｜Structural Mismatch

**State**  
Judgment cannot be formed due to structural constraints  
rather than linguistic ambiguity.

**Description**  
The intent is clear, but constraints such as budget, time,  
or the nature of the task itself prevent judgment from being actionable.

**UI Rescue**  
**No** — Constraints exist outside the UI’s scope.

---

## E｜Authority Override

**State**  
Judgment is formed but overridden by authority or hierarchy.

**Description**  
Even when a better judgment is possible,  
power relationships force compliance and suppress evaluation.

**UI Rescue**  
**No** — This is a governance and power issue.

---

## F｜Explanation Avoidance

**State**  
Judgment exists but its reasoning is intentionally withheld.

**Description**  
Explanation is avoided because it is expected to fail,  
cause conflict, or incur emotional cost.

**UI Rescue**  
**No** — Rooted in trust, emotion, or relational breakdown.

---

## G｜Surface Compliance

**State**  
Judgment appears resolved but is only superficially addressed  
(*pseudo-resolved*).

**Description**  
The actor avoids taking ownership of judgment  
and responds only to pass the situation.

**UI Rescue**  
**Partial** — UI can clarify roles and responsibility,  
but cannot enforce ownership.

---

## What this theory does not attempt

- Not a tool to resolve vague requests  
- Not a UX best-practice framework  
- Not a decision automation system  

---

## Status

- **Judgment Structure — V1 (Theory)**
- Observational / exploratory
- Structural model of judgment types established
- UI sketches and interaction design in progress

---

## Next

- **Theory v2** will focus on meaning formation  
  using a model such as:  
  **M = f(Speaker, Receiver, Context)**

This theory explains *why* certain judgment failures  
are structurally impossible to resolve via UI.
